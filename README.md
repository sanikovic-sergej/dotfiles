# Personal .dotfiles
A public repo with .dotfiles for easier transfer of configurations.
With this repository i shall save my setup and improve on it instead of
starting from scratch and remembering all my steps.

# Goals
- [ ] switch to zsh as a main from bash
- [ ] .bashrc to have as backup
- [x] Alacritty + tmux
- [ ] Somehow create a Pipewire audio filter chain, that makes mics useable
