# Personal .dotfiles
A public repo with .dotfiles for easier transfer of configurations.
With this repository i shall save my setup and improve on it instead of
starting from scratch and remembering all my steps.

# Goals
- [ ] switch to zsh as a main from bash
    - The Theme will be based on https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train.zsh
        - [ ] Adjust Time to be at the end of the first line (right corner)
        - [ ] Adjust Git check symbol and red dot. They look outdated. Maybe a Font Problem
    - [x] Same Thing for Tmux https://github.com/caiogondim/maglev
        - [ ] Fix "? 0%" on no battery devices
- [ ] .bashrc to have as backup
- [x] Alacritty + tmux
    - Based Themes of Alacritty and Nvim to Tokiyo-Storm
- [ ] Somehow create a Pipewire audio filter chain, that makes mics useable
- [ ] Switching to git-submodules for plugins?
- [ ] keep track of additional packages
    - ripgrep [fzf in neovim]
    - python3-venv [mason in neovim]
    - tmux, nvim, zsh, pipewire [DUH!]
